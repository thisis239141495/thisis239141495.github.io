Hi! I am Yitong Wang, also go by Winnie. 

As a junior at Vanderbilt University, pursuing double majors in Mathematics and Computer Science, my research interest lies in the intersection of machine learning, combinatorial optimization, and mechanism design, particularly in their application to large-scale, real-world systems such as emergency response or urban resource allocation, namely incorporating non-human assistances in human-managed social-scale systems; I am also interested an advanced algorithm enthusiast.

These are the questions I am trying to answer through my research: 
* How can machine learning structure be used to assist or enhance human-managed systems under high-stress conditions?
* How can we ensure the scalability of AI-based solutions in social-scale systems, such that they remain robust and efficient when deployed across diverse, large-scale environments?
* How can algorithm optimized models be restructured to better fit the specific demands of resource-constrained social-scale systems?

Ultimately, I seek to design learning-based systems that are not only mathematically sound and algorithmically efficient, but also deployable, adaptive, and impactful in real-world, human-centric domains.

In personal life, I am passionate about playing soccer and tennis, solving sudoku and GeoGuessr, and photographing. I am proudly an Arsenal fan since I was 10.
