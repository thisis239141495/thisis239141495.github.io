As a sophomore at Vanderbilt University, pursuing double majors in Mathematics and Computer Science with minors in Data Science and Political Science, I have broad interests in interdisciplinary studies in social science and computer science and applying methods in artificial intelligence to solve real-world issues, particularly in human-computer interaction, operation research and computational social science. Besides computer science research, I am fortunate to be exposed by classics, literature, history, and philosophy both in and outside of classroom, which makes me feel the art of words and shapes my thought of life.

In personal life, I am passionate about playing soccer and tennis, solving sudoku, building LEGO and photographing. I am proudly an Arsenal fan since I was 10.
