Hi! I am Yitong Wang, also go by Winnie. 

As a sophomore at Vanderbilt University, pursuing double majors in Mathematics and Computer Science with minors in Data Science and Economics, I have broad interests in applying methods in artificial intelligence to solve real-world issues, particularly in operations research. The topic I am currently interested in is machine learning for combinatorial optimization.

In personal life, I am passionate about playing soccer and tennis, solving sudoku and GeoGuessr, building LEGO and photographing. I am proudly an Arsenal fan since I was 10.
