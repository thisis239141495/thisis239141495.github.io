As a first-year student at Vanderbilt University, pursuing double majors in Mathematics and Computer Science with minors in Data Science and Political Science, I am passionate in interdisciplinary studies in social science and computer science and applying my skills in data analysis and modeling to real-world issues, particularly in ameliorating social inequality and assisting vulnerable groups through technical empowerment and a humanistic approach. 

In personal life, I enjoy playing soccer and tennis, doing sudoku and debating. I am proudly an Arsenal fan since 10.
