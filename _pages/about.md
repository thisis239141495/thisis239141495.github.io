Hi! I am Yitong Wang, also go by Winnie. 

As a junior at Vanderbilt University, pursuing double majors in Mathematics and Computer Science, my research interest lies in the intersection of **machine learning**, **dynamic optimization**, and **mechanism design**, particularly in their application to large-scale, real-world systems, namely **incorporating non-human assistances in the decision-making process of human-managed social-scale systems**; I am also an advanced algorithm enthusiast.

These are the questions I am trying to answer through my research: 
* How can learning algorithms be used to assist or enhance decsion-making in human-managed systems under high-stress conditions?
* How can algorithm optimized models be restructured to better fit the specific demands of resource-constrained social-scale systems?
* How can we ensure the scalability of learning-based solutions, such that they remain robust and efficient when deployed across diverse, large-scale environments?

Ultimately, I seek to design learning-based decision-making systems that are not only mathematically and algorithmically efficient, but also deployable, adaptive, and impactful in real-world, human-centric domains.

In personal life, I am passionate about playing soccer and tennis, solving sudoku and GeoGuessr, and photographing. I am proudly an Arsenal fan since I was 10.
